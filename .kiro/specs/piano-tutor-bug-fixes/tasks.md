# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix progress bar click-to-seek functionality
  - Implement proper time calculation from progress bar click position
  - Add immediate staff position updates when progress bar is clicked
  - Ensure playback line attaches to nearest note after progress bar interaction
  - Add smooth transition animations for progress bar jumps
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement progress bar drag functionality with real-time staff updates
  - Add continuous staff position updates during progress bar drag operations
  - Implement smooth staff scrolling that follows drag movements in real-time
  - Ensure drag operations provide immediate visual feedback without lag
  - Add proper drag state management to prevent conflicts with other interactions
  - _Requirements: 1.4_

- [x] 3. Clean up tempo control display to match original design
  - Remove "BPM" text from tempo control display
  - Ensure only quarter note symbol (â™©=) and number are shown
  - Verify discrete BPM values match original implementation (40, 60, 72, 90, 120, 144, 168, 180, 200)
  - Test tempo control styling consistency across different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement staff snapping to nearest note after manual navigation
  - Add automatic position adjustment when user finishes dragging staff
  - Implement note detection algorithm to find nearest note to current position
  - Add smooth transition animation for snapping to note positions
  - Handle edge cases when no notes are nearby (snap to measure boundaries)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Fix virtual piano keyboard visual styling to match original
  - Update key colors to exactly match original HTML implementation
  - Fix key dimensions and proportions to match original design
  - Implement correct visual feedback for key press states (hover, active, pressed)
  - Add proper color coding for different key states (correct, incorrect, active)
  - Ensure responsive behavior matches original design on mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_

- [ ] 6. Implement audio feedback for virtual piano keyboard
  - Add immediate audio playback when virtual keys are pressed
  - Implement clean note release when keys are released
  - Enable polyphonic playback for multiple simultaneous key presses
  - Ensure rapid key presses trigger audio without delay or missed notes
  - Add graceful fallback when audio is unavailable (visual feedback continues)
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Fix staff notation scrolling and positioning during playback
  - Implement smooth staff scrolling during song playback
  - Add responsive manual navigation with proper touch and mouse support
  - Ensure playback line stays centered when staff scrolls automatically
  - Fix immediate position updates when jumping to different song positions
  - Maintain proper alignment of measure bars and notes during all scrolling operations
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 8. Enhance progress bar accuracy and responsiveness
  - Fix smooth progress bar updates during song playback
  - Implement immediate progress indicator jumps when clicked
  - Add real-time feedback during drag operations
  - Ensure smooth animations without jitter or lag
  - Display 100% completion accurately when song ends
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 9. Fix MIDI controls and device connection reliability
  - Implement clear MIDI connection status display
  - Ensure MIDI input triggers same responses as virtual keyboard
  - Add proper visual feedback on virtual keyboard for MIDI input
  - Implement graceful fallback to virtual keyboard when MIDI disconnects
  - Ensure MIDI audio playback works identically to virtual keyboard
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_
