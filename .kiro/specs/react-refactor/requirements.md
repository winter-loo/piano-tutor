# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing Piano Tutor application from a monolithic 11,884-line HTML file into a modern, maintainable React application using Vite as the build tool. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Piano Tutor application to be built with React components, so that the codebase is more maintainable and easier to extend with new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the application SHALL be built using React 18+ with Vite as the build tool
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL preserve all existing functionality from the original HTML file
3. WHEN components are created THEN each component SHALL have a single responsibility and be reusable where appropriate
4. WHEN the project structure is established THEN it SHALL follow React best practices with clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the large monolithic JavaScript classes to be converted to React hooks and state management, so that state is managed in a predictable and React-native way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript classes are converted THEN they SHALL be replaced with custom React hooks where appropriate
2. WHEN state management is implemented THEN it SHALL use Zustand for global state management
3. WHEN audio functionality is refactored THEN the AudioEngine class SHALL be converted to a useAudioEngine hook
4. WHEN MIDI functionality is refactored THEN MIDI classes SHALL be converted to a useMIDI hook and React components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI components to be properly separated and modular, so that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PianoKeyboard is extracted THEN it SHALL be a standalone React component with proper props interface
2. WHEN the StaffNotation is extracted THEN it SHALL be a React component with subcomponents for PlaybackLine and NotesContainer
3. WHEN MIDI controls are extracted THEN they SHALL be React components with proper state management
4. WHEN overlays are extracted THEN StartOverlay and EndingOverlay SHALL be separate React components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing audio functionality to work exactly as before, so that my learning experience is not disrupted by the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN Tone.js integration SHALL work identically to the original
2. WHEN I play notes on the virtual keyboard THEN audio feedback SHALL be immediate and accurate
3. WHEN I use MIDI devices THEN all MIDI functionality SHALL work as in the original application
4. WHEN tempo changes are made THEN audio playback SHALL adjust accordingly without glitches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing MIDI device functionality to be preserved, so that I can continue using my physical piano with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect a MIDI device THEN the connection process SHALL work identically to the original
2. WHEN MIDI input is received THEN note recognition and feedback SHALL function as before
3. WHEN I access MIDI settings THEN the configuration popup SHALL provide the same options
4. WHEN devices are disconnected THEN fallback to virtual keyboard SHALL work seamlessly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS to be properly organized and modular, so that styling is maintainable and component-scoped where appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN each component SHALL have its own CSS file or styled-components
2. WHEN global styles are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and organized
3. WHEN responsive design is implemented THEN it SHALL maintain the same breakpoints and behavior
4. WHEN CSS is refactored THEN all visual styling SHALL remain identical to the original

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and loading states, so that the application is robust and provides good user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN React Error Boundaries SHALL catch and handle them gracefully
2. WHEN audio is initializing THEN loading states SHALL be displayed to users
3. WHEN MIDI devices are connecting THEN appropriate feedback SHALL be shown
4. WHEN components fail to load THEN fallback UI SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized, so that the application loads quickly and performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN Vite SHALL provide fast development builds and optimized production builds
2. WHEN components are large THEN code splitting SHALL be implemented to improve load times
3. WHEN the application loads THEN initial bundle size SHALL be reasonable for web delivery
4. WHEN assets are processed THEN they SHALL be optimized for production deployment

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing setup, so that refactored functionality can be verified and regressions prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is set up THEN unit tests SHALL be available for critical components
2. WHEN audio functionality is tested THEN mock implementations SHALL allow testing without actual audio
3. WHEN MIDI functionality is tested THEN device simulation SHALL enable testing without physical devices
4. WHEN integration tests are written THEN they SHALL verify component interactions work correctly

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and migration notes, so that the refactored codebase is easy to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN README SHALL document the new project structure
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL have proper JSDoc comments and prop documentation
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN a migration guide SHALL document changes from the original
4. WHEN the project is set up THEN development setup instructions SHALL be clear and complete
